# 🌿 BioCertify: Peer-to-Peer Biofuel Certificate Trading

Welcome to BioCertify, a decentralized Web3 platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts! This project addresses the real-world challenge of ensuring transparency and verifiability in sustainability claims for international transport fuels, such as aviation and maritime biofuels. By enabling peer-to-peer trading of biofuel certificates, it prevents fraud like double-counting, ensures compliance with global standards (e.g., EU RED II or ICAO CORSIA), and empowers producers, traders, and consumers to trade certified sustainable fuel credits securely and immutably.

## ✨ Features
🔄 Peer-to-peer trading of biofuel certificates without intermediaries  
✅ Immutable verification of sustainability claims using on-chain data  
📊 Traceable supply chain from biofuel production to consumption  
🚫 Anti-fraud mechanisms to prevent duplicate or invalid certificates  
🌍 Compliance with international regulations via smart contract rules  
💰 Escrow-based safe trades with automated settlements  
📈 Marketplace for listing, bidding, and auctioning certificates  
🔒 User roles for producers, verifiers, traders, and regulators  

## 🛠 How It Works
BioCertify leverages the Stacks blockchain to create a transparent ecosystem for biofuel certificates. Certificates represent verified units of sustainable biofuel (e.g., 1 certificate = 1 ton of CO2e reduction). Producers register certificates, traders buy/sell them P2P, and verifiers confirm claims—all on-chain.

**For Biofuel Producers**  
- Verify your production data off-chain (e.g., via audits) and generate a unique hash.  
- Call the `issue-certificate` function with details like biofuel type, sustainability metrics, and proof hash.  
- Your certificate is minted as a tradeable token, timestamped immutably.  

**For Traders and Buyers**  
- Browse the marketplace to find listed certificates.  
- Initiate a trade via `create-offer` or bid in auctions.  
- Use escrow to lock funds; trade completes automatically on confirmation.  
- Transfer ownership seamlessly while maintaining the certificate's audit trail.  

**For Verifiers and Regulators**  
- Query `verify-certificate` to check ownership, validity, and compliance.  
- Access audit logs for full traceability.  
- Flag invalid claims through governance votes if discrepancies arise.  

That's it! Trades are fast, secure, and globally accessible, reducing paperwork and trust issues in international fuel markets.

## 📂 Smart Contracts
This project involves 8 Clarity smart contracts to handle various aspects of certificate lifecycle, trading, and governance. Here's a high-level overview:  

1. **CertificateRegistry.clar**: Manages issuance and registration of biofuel certificates, storing metadata like production details, sustainability scores, and unique hashes. Ensures no duplicates via hash checks.  

2. **BioToken.clar**: Implements a fungible token (SIP-010 compliant) representing biofuel certificates, allowing fractional trading (e.g., partial tons). Handles minting, burning, and transfers.  

3. **Marketplace.clar**: Facilitates P2P listings, offers, and auctions. Users can list certificates for sale or auction with time-bound bids.  

4. **Escrow.clar**: Provides secure escrow for trades, locking buyer funds and seller certificates until conditions (e.g., verification) are met, then auto-releases.  

5. **VerifierOracle.clar**: Integrates off-chain verification data (e.g., via trusted oracles) to confirm sustainability claims, updating on-chain status.  

6. **ComplianceChecker.clar**: Enforces rules based on international standards, automatically validating certificates against predefined criteria (e.g., GHG reduction thresholds).  

7. **AuditLog.clar**: Maintains an immutable log of all actions (issuance, trades, verifications) for traceability and audits.  

8. **Governance.clar**: Allows token holders to vote on system updates, dispute resolutions, or parameter changes (e.g., adding new compliance rules).  

These contracts interact seamlessly—for example, the Marketplace calls Escrow during trades, and ComplianceChecker is queried before any issuance or transfer.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repo, deploy the Clarity contracts to Stacks testnet, and integrate with a frontend (e.g., React + Hiro Wallet). Test by issuing sample certificates and simulating trades. Let's make sustainable transport fuels truly verifiable! 🌱
